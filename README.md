# Text Classification Project

## Description

The Text Classification Project is designed to classify text data into predefined categories using machine learning techniques. This project demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms to analyze and categorize text based on its content.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and text normalization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- **Model Training**: Implements various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- **Predictions**: Allows for making predictions on new, unseen text data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (if using neural networks)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
